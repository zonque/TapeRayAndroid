	    	<p>TapeRay was developed as a community for art-enthusiasts using vinyl
	    	foil as their expression media. This type of art is also widely known
	    	as WALL DECAL.</p>
     		<p>This application is able to map all TapeRay artworks into a live
        	video image, recorded by the camera of your mobile phone.
        	You can resize the artworks with finger gestures and move them around
        	to get a feeling of how they might look like on the place where you want
        	them. </p>
